# DESCRIPTION

This command evaluates partition design solution.

# OPTIONS

`-num_parts`:  Number of partitions. The default value is `2`, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`.

`-balance_constraint`:  Allowed imbalance between blocks. The default value is `1.0`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-base_balance`:  Tcl list of baseline imbalance between partitions. The default value is `{1.0}`, and the allowed values are floats that sum up to `1.0`.

`-scale_factor`:  KIV. The default value is `{1.0}`, and the allowed values are floats that sum up to `1.0`.

`-timing_aware_flag`:  Enable timing-driven mode. The default value is `true`, and the allowed values are booleans.

`-top_n`:  Extract the top n critical timing paths. The default value is `1000`, and the allowed values are integers `[0, MAX_INT]`.

`-fence_flag`:  Consider fences in the partitioning. The default value is `false`, and the allowed values are booleans.

`-fence_lx`:  Fence lower left x in microns. The default value is `0.0`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-fence_ly`:  Fence lower left y in microns. The default value is `0.0`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-fence_ux`:  Fence upper right x in microns. The default value is `0.0`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-fence_uy`:  Fence upper right y in microns. The default value is `0.0`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-fixed_file`:  Path to fixed vertices constraint file.

`-community_file`:  Path to `community` attributes file to guide the partitioning process.

`-group_file`:  Path to `stay together` attributes file.

`-hypergraph_file`:  Path to hypergraph file.

`-hypergraph_int_weight_file`:  Path to `hMETIS` format integer weight file.

`-solution_file`:  Path to solution file.

`-net_timing_factor`:  Hyperedge timing weight factor. The default value is `1.0`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-path_timing_factor`:  Cutting critical timing path weight factor. The default value is `1.0`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-path_snaking_factor`:  Snaking a critical path weight factor. The default value is `1.0`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-timing_exp_factor`:  Timing exponential factor for normalized slack. The default value is `1.0`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-extra_delay`:  Extra delay introduced by a cut. The default value is `1e-9`, and the allowed values are floats.

`-guardband_flag`:  Enable timing guardband option. The default value is 1`false`, and the allowed values are booleans.

`-e_wt_factors`:  Hyperedge weight factors.

`-v_wt_factors`:  Vertex weight factors.
