# DESCRIPTION

The `place_pins` command places all pins together. Use the following command to perform pin placement:

Developer arguments:
- `-random`, `-random_seed`

# OPTIONS

`-hor_layers`:  The layers to create the metal shapes of pins placed in horizontal tracks. It can be a single layer or a list of layer names.

`-ver_layers`:  The layers to create the metal shapes of pins placed in vertical tracks. It can be a single layer or a list of layer names.

`-corner_avoidance`:  The distance (in microns) from each corner within which pin placement should be avoided.

`-min_distance`:  The minimum distance between pins on the die boundary. This distance can be in microns (default) or in number of tracks between each pin. The default value is the length of two routing tracks between each pin.

`-min_distance_in_tracks`:  Flag that allows setting the min distance in number of tracks instead of microns.

`-exclude`:  A region where pins cannot be placed. Either `top|bottom|left|right:edge_interval`, which is the edge interval from the selected edge; `begin:end` for begin-end of all edges.

`-group_pins`:  A list of pins to be placed together on the die boundary.

`-annealing`:  Flag to enable simulated annealing pin placement.

`-write_pin_placement`:  A file with the pin placement generated in the format of multiple calls for the `place_pin` command.

# ARGUMENTS

`-random_seed`:  Specify the seed for random operations.

`-random`:  When this flag is enabled, the pin placement is random.
