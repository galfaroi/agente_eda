The HEP alliance is a consortium of 8 academic and industry partners that are building the next generation of hardware security chips using fully open-source processors and EDA tools.</p>    <p>Hardware trust and secure microelectronics are key requirements that must be fulfilled by an integrated flow from architecture, design to manufacturing platform for an innovative, end-end chip design solution. These devices must function reliably and protect against malfunctions, attacks and accidents during operation. The use of open-source tools and processors are key components and provide differentiated capabilities in building and proving feasibility of this design ecosystem that are not otherwise possible using commercial tools.</p>    <p><a href="http://theopenroadproject.org">OpenROAD</a> is an important application for the generation and support of reliable, open-source hardware for trusted microelectronics. It has recently enabled the PDK support for the BiCMOS process technology created by <a href="https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK">IHP</a>. OpenROAD is already silicon-proven in building SoCs using the RISC-V processor and its derivatives.</p>    <p>This is a 3 year project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) aimed at boosting the local semiconductor industry and EWD (Education and Workforce Development) at scale&nbsp; for Germany.</p>    <p>This blog shares the use of OpenROAD as part of this important strategy for the creation of trusted hardware. <strong>Tim Henkes</strong> from <a href="https://www.hs-rm.de/en/">RheinMain University of Applied Sciences</a>, a part of VE-HEP,&nbsp; shares his experience using the OpenROAD flow and other open-source tools to design and successfully tape out hardware security blocks.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leveraging an open-source strategy for trusted microelectronics</h2>    <p>The ability to create hardware for trusted microelectronics using open-source tools and hardware has far-reaching applications from military, defense, sensor based systems and personal devices. Trusted microelectronics based applications are especially important to the automotive industry since they are central to the business, brand and reputation.&nbsp; The use of open-source specifically for design of secure hardware offers unique advantages&nbsp; and enhances required capabilities:</p>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Safety and Security<ul><li>Prevention of cyber attacks and unlawful access to vehicle&nbsp; and passenger information systems</li></ul> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Ensuring safety of both passenger and vehicle by preventing attacks on systems like anti-lock braking, collision avoidance, autonomous driving controls etc.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Reliability <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Safe and reliable operation of the vehicle throughout its lifecycle under variable environmental conditions of temperature, vibrations , maintenance etc.</li> </ul> </li>    <li>Supply chain resilience <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Prevent counterfeiting and unauthorized hardware modifications that are dangerous and severely compromise passenger vehicle safety.</li> </ul> </li>    <li>Compliance, Audits and Regulatory standards<ul><li>Guaranteeing compliance, scrutiny and trust for environmental, safety and quality standards</li></ul> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Ability to modify processor and hardware architecture for future generation of vehicles and standards.</li> </ul> </li>    <li>Continuous Innovation and Collaboration <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Open-source tools and flows foster continuous innovation and collaboration among a diverse community of stakeholders: hardware designers, verification engineers, and security experts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>    <p>The figure below shows the architecture envisioned by the VE-HEP project to build a reliable and flexible model for trusted microelectronics using open-source design tools and processors.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="606" height="460" src="https://theopenroadproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/security-module-and-smart-sensor.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6162"/></figure>    <p>Image source : HEP alliance</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">RISC-V and OpenROAD : A trusted flow for HSMs</h2>    <p>VE-HEP chose RISC-V as the processor along with OpenROAD to build and study the feasibility of trusted electronics for security using <a href="https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK">IHP Open PDK</a>.</p>    <p>RISC-V is the natural choice for many applications today due to its open, flexible architecture, ability to design without licensing costs and to rapidly create custom applications for a wide range of technology nodes. The choice of RISC-V with OpenROAD enables a wide range of applications based on IHP’s high performance, 130nm BiCMOS technology: Automotive, IoT, HPC, Medical, Space and Communications and many more.</p>    <p>OpenROAD is the foundational application for SoC design that has been deployed in many silicon-proven designs in &gt; 600+ tapeouts, many of them based on RISC-V microcontrollers.</p>    <p>VE-HEP successfully taped out three designs using OpenROAD in 2023–two of these used OpenLane and the proprietary PDK for the sg13g2 BiCMOS process and produced successfully working chips!. In Dec 2023, Tim switched the flow to use, <a href="https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts">OpenROAD-flow-scripts</a> (ORFS) for these advantages:</p>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Fully open-source, Autonomous, No-Human-in-Loop (NHIL)&nbsp; flow from RTL-GDS</li>    <li>Compatibility to other open-source and commercial tools</li>    <li>Support for the IHP PDK</li>    <li>Ease-of-use and flexibility</li>    <li>Developer friendly for easy integration and customization</li>    <li>Rapid turnaround for problem fixes and feature requests</li> </ul>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Open-source for Design Hardening and Algorithmic security</h2>    <p>Building trustworthy, reproducible and verifiable electronics requires a radically new approach in the design and manufacturing of chip components i.e processor, EDA tools and design and verification methodologies. Chips used for cryptographic operations must ensure algorithmic security during operation without leaking information or becoming vulnerable to hardware attacks.</p>    <p>Open Source design tools allow for code inspection ensuring that the EDA tool itself does not add any trojan to the hardware.</p>    <p> <a href="https://www.forschung-it-sicherheit-kommunikationssysteme.de/projekte/ve-hep">VE-HEP</a> aims to deliver such a flow created around open-source tools and design components that can be independently customized to suit specific requirements for hardware security  and supply chain sovereignty. To paraphrase their vision for the project : “Hardening the value chain through open-source, trustworthy EDA tools and processors, is to realize essential parts of the entire value chain in the area of ​​development and production of security-relevant chips (hardware security modules) in open source for the first time”.</p>    <p>OpenROAD enables transparency, ownership and hardening of critical cryptographic blocks earlier in the design stage unlike the late stage hardening supported in commercial tools. The OpenROAD based No-Human-in-Loop, RTL-GDS2 flow minimizes human intervention across vulnerable stages of the design. It automatically executes synthesis, DRC-correct PnR with support using the recently enabled open-source IHP PDK. This&nbsp; makes it possible to prevent hardware trojan attacks, ensure wider transparency and scrutiny across the design and user community and scrutiny.</p>    <p>Hardware security modules (HSMs) store sensitive cryptographic keys and perform secure operations and are often vulnerable to attacks. Side channel attacks exploit unintended design and algorithmic weaknesses that leak information such as power and timing variations that can then be used to infer cryptographic keys and other sensitive information. Prevention of side channel attacks is a key requirement in the design and manufacturing of such hardware security blocks. Another mechanism used by hardware designers&nbsp; is that of logic locking which allows the insertion of gates to encrypt critical functionality at the RTL level. Logic locking&nbsp; protects the firmware and cryptographic algorithms implemented in these devices from tampering and reverse-engineering.&nbsp; A multi-level approach to creating trusted hardware using open-source combines several of these techniques for secure hardware implementation and verification at various design stages thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability in the design process and reducing costs.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Created HSMs using OpenROAD</h2>    <p>“The transition from OpenLane to ORFS was painless. Since both use OpenROAD for large parts of the flow, knowledge acquired from using OpenLane transferred well to ORFS and it was not hard to set up the project build with ORFS. The design (Verilog) was exactly the same for the second and third tapeout.”, says Tim Henkes, describing the transition to ORFS.</p>    <p>The design consists of a RISC-V core, VexRiscv, extended with masked AES as well as a large number multiplication units with 8, 32KiB SRAMs.</p>    <p>The design description uses <a href="https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/master/SpinalHDL/Introduction/SpinalHDL.html">SpinalHDL</a> that provides useful <a href="https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/master/SpinalHDL/Introduction/SpinalHDL.html#advantages-of-using-spinalhdl-over-vhdl-verilog">advantages</a><a href="https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/master/SpinalHDL/Introduction/SpinalHDL.html#advantages-of-using-spinalhdl-over-vhdl-verilog"> </a>over conventional RTL descriptions to generate Verilog which was then synthesized and routed using OpenROAD-flow-scripts.</p>    <p>The design source is located here: <a href="https://github.com/HEP-Alliance/VE-HEP-HW-SW">https://github.com/HEP-Alliance/VE-HEP-HW-SW</a>.</p>    <p>Refer to the ORFS design repository containing all the relevant scripts and design artifacts here: <a href="https://github.com/HEP-Alliance/hsm">https://github.com/HEP-Alliance/hsm</a></p>    <p>The design flow consists of a single pass of the NHIL flow in ORFS to generate the layout from the synthesized netlist. The entire design is hardened in a single pass to ensure security in the design stages.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Results</h2>    <p>The figure below shows the final GDS layout for the ASIC, including SRAM, the VexRiscv core and the AES block generated in the OpenROAD flow .</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="577" height="588" src="https://theopenroadproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Layout-of-ASIC.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6168"/></figure>    <p>Final layout of the ASIC using OpenROAD-flow-scripts</p>    <p>The successfully taped out chip is now being tested at the board level (shown below)</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="595" height="412" src="https://theopenroadproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Board.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6164"/></figure>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Future vision for Trusted Hardware and supply chain</h2>    <p>HEP plans to expand this project to include other key components that strengthen hardware security features that enhance random number generation (TRNG), physical unclonability (PUF)&nbsp; and protection of chip hardware (eFuses).</p>    <p>“Most importantly we want to add root-of-trust elements like a TRNG, potentially a PUF or eFuses. This will be a large part of the follow-up project we are currently planning. Parts of those efforts concern the tooling, other parts the open PDK.” concludes Tim, as he looks ahead into the near future plans for the project.</p>    <p>This aligns very closely with Germany’s and Europe’s vision for the semiconductor and IT industry.</p>    <p>OpenROAD is a critical enabler and partner in the effort to build trusted electronics and strengthen the hardware supply chain for the semiconductor industry at large.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reference Links</h2>    <p><a href="https://riscv.org/news/2023/10/research-consortium-sets-standards-in-the-field-of-open-source-hardware-open-tools-used-for-a-security-chip/">https://riscv.org/news/2023/10/research-consortium-sets-standards-in-the-field-of-open-source-hardware-open-tools-used-for-a-security-chip/</a></p>    <p><a href="https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK">https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK</a></p> ]]></content:encoded>                </item>   <item>   <title>OpenROAD projects for GSoC 2024 are announced and ready for applications!</title>   <link>https://theopenroadproject.org/openroad-projects-for-gsoc-2024-are-announced-and-ready-for-applications/</link>      <dc:creator><![CDATA[ucriyaz]]></dc:creator>   <pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 04:08:23 +0000</pubDate>     <category><![CDATA[Blogs]]></category>   <guid isPermaLink="false">https://theopenroadproject.org/?p=6159</guid>       <description><![CDATA[OpenROAD projects for GSoC 2024 are announced and ready for applications!

Hello 2024! Greetings and a Happy New Year from the Precision Innovations team and The OpenROAD Project! Together, we enable innovation, learning, and building chips with lowered barriers of cost, access and expertise. This has been the mission and focus of the OpenROAD project since its inception in the DARPA IDEA program. Thank you to all for your engagement and support, and looking forward to your ongoing contributions!</p>    <p>2023 has been a year of expansion for OpenROAD across many areas: more tapeouts in silicon, more deployments toward education and workforce training, and many important tool enhancements.</p>    <p>Here, we overview important milestones achieved in 2023 and OpenROAD’s plans for 2024.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tried and Tested for Real-world Applications</h2>    <p>OpenROAD has been used for 600+ tapeouts in the Google OpenMPW shuttle program and the <a href="https://efabless.com/">Efabless</a><a href="https://efabless.com/"> </a><a href="https://efabless.com/">Chipignite</a> program. These include many RISC-V based SoC designs using the OpenROAD-based flows <a href="https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts">OpenROAD-flow-scripts</a> (ORFS) and <a href="https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane">OpenLane</a>.&nbsp; The combined benefits of an open processor ISA, open-source tool integration, and low costs of hardware development have enabled applications – from IoT and sensors to advanced processors and hardware accelerators – across a wide range of functions and technology nodes.</p>    <p>The true test of open-source tools like OpenROAD is how they apply and perform in the real world. A notable application is building hardware security and root-of-trust designs. The following are two example designs using <a href="https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts">OpenROAD-flow-scripts</a>.</p>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong>Root-of-trust. </strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://ece.engin.umich.edu/personnel/saligane-mehdi">Mehdi Saligane</a> of the University of Michigan has taped out an <strong>Intel 16nm</strong>-based SoC containing digital and analog components such as a hardware security block, a processor and a temperature sensor. Specifically, the AES crypto core, the Ibex RISC-V processor, and the temperature sensor were built using OpenROAD and ORFS. Details will follow in a separate blog.</li>    <li><strong>Trusted microelectronics</strong> is an initiative of <a href="https://hep-alliance.org/Project/">HEP-Alliance</a>, a group funded by the German government.&nbsp; The initiative develops trusted security hardware, with strategic use of OpenROAD and other open-source tools, along with a resilient supply chain. Their design consists of a RISC-V core, VexRiscv, extended with masked AES as well as a large-number multiplication unit with eight 32KiB SRAMs. <a href="https://www.forschung-it-sicherheit-kommunikationssysteme.de/projekte/ve-hep">VE-HEP</a> taped out their third update of this design in December 2023. Details will follow in a separate blog.&nbsp;</li> </ul>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Advancing Energy-efficient Processors Using Open-Source Design</h2>    <p>Semiconductor startups are starting to leverage open-source tools to realize their designs. With OpenROAD, they gain the benefits of low cost, rapid innovation, transparency and expert support from Precision Innovations.</p>    <p>As one example, <a href="https://www.ascenium.com/">Ascenium</a> deployed OpenROAD to develop energy-efficient designs for their General Purpose Processor using a 7nm ASAP7 PDK. Early and rapid microarchitectural exploration is key to their design strategy for development of high-performance, energy-efficient processors with significantly lower costs and greater efficiency than what is possible with commercial EDA tools. The Ascenium team is beginning to see significant progress in the tool usability, stability, and the rich features in the GUI needed to support their differentiated flow and design targets. Øyvind Harboe, VP of Engineering, has been spearheading this effort through an efficient support model with Precision Innovations; he engages proactively in a test-feedback-fix cycle that has been a win-win for all – Ascenium, Precision Innovations, the OpenROAD tool, and the user community at large. Harboe has pioneered a paradigm-shifting approach to designing stringent processor requirements for AI and other advanced applications, enabled by OpenROAD. He remarks:&nbsp;</p>    <p>       <strong>“OpenROAD has made a quantum leap in terms of scalability and stability in 2023. We use Bazel </strong>     <strong>with OpenROAD-flow-scripts to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our workflows as we run multiple experiments, continuously integrate and test design changes. We are seeing many improvements overall in terms of the ability to handle large designs with complex macros, constraints that must be managed across the design hierarchy and efficient placement of specialized instances such as large arrays of standard cells. We look forward to enhancements to CTS, hierarchical timing analysis and other features like the automatic macro placement in OpenROAD to get to the superior performance and power targets that our processors deliver over conventional CPU architectures.”</strong></p>    <p>We expect other semiconductor startups to use OpenROAD and gain similar advantages of cost and schedule by combining the best of open-source and commercial EDA tools.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scaling Education and Workforce Development</h2>    <p>OpenROAD is now a leading platform and on-ramp for VLSI education around the world. OpenROAD-based courses and training are the standard for barrier-free and hands-on education and workforce development across many institutions.&nbsp; Importantly, this supports both growth and stability of semiconductor economies across the entire ecosystem.</p>    <p>Much progress has been made to build scalable and flexible courses, workshops and training programs to serve a wide range of learners, including high schoolers, undergraduates, advanced postgraduates, (Master’s and Ph.D.) and summer interns.</p>    <p>The following are some key highlights:</p>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>University courses<ul><li><a href="https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/certificates/silicon-chip-design-and-semiconductor-engineering/">https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/certificates/silicon-chip-design-and-semiconductor-engineering/</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/events/asic-design-using-openroad/">https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/events/asic-design-using-openroad/</a></li></ul> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><a href="https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc24_ee77/preview">https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc24_ee77/preview</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Education and workforce, faculty development programs<ul><li><a href="https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/vsdopen2023/">https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/vsdopen2023/</a><br><a href="https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/basic_courses/">https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/basic_courses/</a></li></ul> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><a href="https://nitc.ac.in/imgserver/uploads/attachments/Ed__fc1aacac-cc58-4d6c-8d13-9e9f9c1e29ee_.pdf">Faculty Development Program on Chip Design</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Upskilling at scale <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7139837260094517248?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7139837260094517248%29">Workshop on </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7139837260094517248?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7139837260094517248%29">“</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7139837260094517248?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7139837260094517248%29">OpenROAD for Low-cost ASIC design for Rapid Innovation”</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Hands-on learning: from silicon to tapeout<ul><li><a href="https://ieee-cas.org/universalization-ic-design-cass-unic-cass">https://ieee-cas.org/universalization-ic-design-cass-unic-cass</a></li></ul> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><a href="https://tinytapeout.com/">https://tinytapeout.com/</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>    <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) OpenROAD internships <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Check out the interesting project accomplishments by our intern, Jack Luar: <a href="https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/report/osre23/ucsd/openroad/20231029-luarss/">https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/report/osre23/ucsd/openroad/20231029-luarss/</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>    <p><a href="https://austinrovin.ski">Austin Rovinski</a>, an original member of the OpenROAD project and ongoing contributor, is an Assistant Professor in the ECE Department at NYU.

This has been well-supported by Precision Innovations for our early adopters. The <a href="https://openroadinitiative.org/">OpenROAD Initiative </a>was launched in 2023 with the goal of further democratizing chip design through active engagement with industry and academia. This non-profit foundation’s initial focus is to broadly support and foster education and workforce initiatives for EDA and semiconductor design.</p>    <p>Our roadmap includes improving the accuracy of advanced analysis (timing, noise, crosstalk). Notably, addition of CCS model support is in progress. For design creation, clock tree synthesis is being enhanced to support more complex design structures with improved usability and optimization QoR. The project team also plans to broaden support for routing capabilities to support advanced nodes &lt;12nm. Finally, OpenROAD is entering the realm of ML and GenAI: a chat assistant and the use of ML-based analysis (IR drop, detailed routing, etc.) are being developed.</p>    <p>So stay tuned and connected!

OpenROAD’s value proposition is that it brings down the barriers of cost, expertise and unpredictability of proprietary solutions which currently block semiconductor creators and innovators.</p> <p>To date, OpenROAD<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> has been used on over 600 tapeouts, on process nodes down to 12nm. Because of its ease-of-use, a growing number of companies have also started to use OpenROAD up front in the development process, during hardware and software architectural exploration. Doing predictive architectural exploration is especially valuable when testing revolutionary new architectures and algorithms where empirical power, performance, and area (PPA) data do not exist.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://theopenroadproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Capture-1024x392.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="100" /></p> <p></p> <p>As commercial processes have become highly proprietary, open predictive technology models available as public PDKS along with OpenROAD’s integrated RTL-GDSII flow, can fill the reliable estimation gap long before detailed design, enabling clear visibility into PPA tradeoffs. For example, the ASAP7 open source 7 nm FinFET PDK, <a href="https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/asap7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported by OpenROAD</a>, includes abstract models for schematic and layout entry, library characterization, synthesis, placement and routing, parasitic extraction, and HSPICE simulation.</p> <p><a href="https://www.precisioninno.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Precision Innovations Inc</a>. (PII) is the primary industrial developer of OpenROAD providing custom support for the main applications, flows and PDKS for a simple, barrier-free use of design exploration and subsequent implementation in OpenROAD.</p> <p>Recently PII partnered with <a href="https://www.ascenium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ascenium</a> to provide dedicated support for design estimation using <a href="https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenROAD flow</a> and ASAP7 to streamline Ascenium’s quest to deliver a new class of a low power, General Purpose Processor, without an instruction set, through an optimized compiler interface. “The exponential influx of data (video, audio, sensor) accelerated by Deep Learning and 5G increases the importance of compute efficiency for energy management.” Said Øyvind Harboe, VP of Engineering at Ascenium. “By leveraging OpenROAD as we explore architectures, get rapid feedback to make important and reliable hardware and software trade offs early in the design cycle before we commit to physical implementation at a fraction of the cost from using commercial tools. If you are someone who hankers to work on something insanely great, something different, &#8211; that can change the industry, leveraging open-source tools, such as LLVM or OpenROAD, then please check out the career opportunities at our website, <a href="http://www.ascenium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.ascenium.com</a>.”</p> <p>If you too would like to talk with PII about dedicated support for your projects, please contact info@precisioninno.com</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>      </div>     </div>      </div>   </div>      </div>   </section>     </div>   ]]></content:encoded>                </item>   <item>   <title>OpenROAD 2022: Year End Review</title>   <link>https://theopenroadproject.org/openroad-2022-year-end-review/</link>      <dc:creator><![CDATA[sivaganesh]]></dc:creator>   <pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 08:08:22 +0000</pubDate>     <category><![CDATA[Blogs]]></category>   <guid isPermaLink="false">https://theopenroadproject.org/?p=5640</guid>       <description><![CDATA[2022 has been a very exciting and productive year for the OpenROAD™ project.

Early testing shows a 10X speedup in detailed routing in select test cases before reaching a plateau.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new partitioner (TritonPart) aims to better manage design instance constraints and cluster engines to yield good global placement which is key to achieving good design quality and faster closure with a potential for a 1X speedup. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, OpenROAD added support for a tighter integration of design data to its open database (ODB) that significantly improved incremental design analyses and optimization. We began creating a full python API to OpenROAD to make it easier to extend and utilize python ML based libraries in applications;this further improved runtime performance especially during optimization.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hierarchical design methodology vastly simplifies design complexity, memory usage and runtime management for large designs (&gt;500k instances). The timing model from netlist was enhanced to provide  better support for design hierarchy and include extracted parasitics at block and interconnect signals for accurate top-level timing analysis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OpenROAD GUI was significantly enhanced– It supports better hierarchy browsing, viewing and analyzing problems such as off-grid pins and routing, rulers and markers, and heatmaps for hotspot analyses.</span></p>      </div>     </div>     <div class="elementor-element elementor-element-cf04621 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image" data-id="cf04621" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default">     <div class="elementor-widget-container">              <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="395" src="https://theopenroadproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/OpenROAD-GUI-768x395.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-image-5642" alt="" />             </div>     </div>     <div class="elementor-element elementor-element-9b5aba2 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor" data-id="9b5aba2" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">     <div class="elementor-widget-container">        <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved QoR through Continuous Innovation and CI</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 we sharpened our focus on PPA targets. The AutoTuner allows designers to get over a 3X runtime speedup over manual design, with best achievable PPA based on user constraint ranges for design parameters. Furthermore, users can capture key design metrics and continuously track QoR and interventions to improve them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RTL-MP showed great potential for large designs in enabling RTL designers to make early design tradeoffs with rapid feedback from the floorpan and thus get better QoR without sacrificing speed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw QoR improvements throughout our gallery of designs.  Here is a sample public dashboard that captures and tracks QoR changes across our nightly builds across a gallery of designs: </span><a href="https://dashboard.theopenroadproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dashboard.theopenroadproject.org/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
