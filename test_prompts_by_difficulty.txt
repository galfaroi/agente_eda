# EASY PROMPTS
# These are single-command operations with simple parameters

1. list all instances in the design
2. report timing
3. read design.def file
4. save design to output.def
5. what is the total design area

# MEDIUM PROMPTS
# These involve specific parameters or single complex operations

1. run global placement with target density 0.7
2. find timing paths with slack worse than -0.5ns
3. create power stripes with width 2um and spacing 10um
4. synthesize clock tree using buf1 as buffer
5. place input pins on left side with spacing 2um

# HARD PROMPTS
# These involve multi-step operations or advanced concepts

1. Timing Optimization Flow:
   - Report worst timing paths
   - Identify cells on critical paths
   - Upsize cells with negative slack
   - Run timing optimization
   - Verify improvement

2. Congestion-Driven Placement:
   - Analyze current congestion
   - Identify congested regions
   - Spread cells in congested areas
   - Maintain timing constraints

3. Power Optimization:
   - Analyze switching activity
   - Identify high power cells
   - Replace with low power alternatives
   - Add power gating where possible
   - Verify power reduction

4. Mixed-Signal Setup:
   - Create separate digital and analog domains
   - Add isolation cells between domains
   - Setup separate power grids
   - Add coupling prevention shields

5. Hierarchical Flow:
   - Partition design into blocks
   - Setup timing budgets for each block
   - Implement blocks separately
   - Perform top-level assembly
   - Verify global timing closure
