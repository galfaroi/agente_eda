# Basic Design Queries
get all instances in the design
list all pins of instance buff1
show timing paths with slack less than 0

# Floorplan Operations
initialize floorplan with utilization 0.7 and aspect ratio 1.2
add power rings with width 2 and spacing 1
create pin placement at bottom of chip

# Placement Queries
perform global placement with density target 0.8
legalize current placement
optimize placement for timing

# Routing Operations
run global routing with overflow threshold 0.1
perform detailed routing in clock nets
fix DRC violations in routing

# Timing Analysis
report worst timing paths
analyze setup violations
check hold timing in clock network

# Power Analysis
estimate power consumption
analyze IR drop in power grid
report switching activity

# Complex Workflows
1. read design and initialize floorplan
2. place standard cells
3. create clock tree
4. perform routing
5. generate timing report

# Python-Specific Queries
get timing paths using Python API
analyze congestion with Python functions
export DEF using Python interface

# Tcl-Specific Queries
write timing reports using Tcl
generate power report with Tcl commands
create clock tree with Tcl script

# Error Cases
do something with the design
modify the thing
change timing somehow
